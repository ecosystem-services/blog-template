SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) â€” At least **one fighter** jet was seen and heard roaring over the East Bay Wednesday afternoon.

The jet appeared to be a F-16 Fighting Falcon, with air-to-air missiles attached to the wing tips.

The Federal Aviation Administration had no information about the fighter jet and referred questions to the U.S. Navy.

There was no notice from NAS Lemoore and a spokesperson for Oakland International Airport had no information about the flight.

A representative reached at Travis Air Force Base said he was unaware of any activity, but would check with the base operations.

A spokesperson for Buchanan Field in Concord said they were aware of the F-16 flight but had no information on what the purpose was.

People in Walnut Creek, Danville and other cities in Contra Costa County offered their reactions on Twitter, and said there was more than one jet.
